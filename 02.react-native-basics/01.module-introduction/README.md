So let's dive into React Native

and let's of course start with the basics.

In this course section,

we are going to explore the core React Native concepts.

This means that we'll dive

into the core React Native Components,

and we will start building user interfaces

with those Components,

but we will of course also dive

into styling React Native apps.

We will learn how we can style those apps

and those Components,

such that we can really build the user interface

we wanna build.

And last but definitely not least,

we will explore how we can add interactivity to our app

and how we can manage state,

how we can make sure that there,

for example are buttons that can be clicked

and that something meaningful happens

when a button is clicked.

Now for this, in this course section,

we are going to build this demo app here.

It's a first simple React Native app

which allows you to track your goals.

For example, your goals for this course,

what you wanna achieve by taking this course

or as you are taking this course.

In this app, we got a list of goals

and we can open a model

and overly to add new goals.

And once a goal was added,

we can also tap the goal to remove it again.

This is maybe not the next billion dollar app

but it's a great first app

to learn about many core fundamentals you must know

about React Native.
